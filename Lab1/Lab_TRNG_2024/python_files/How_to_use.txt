The linked file is a jupyter notebook rather than a regular python file.
In order to open it you need to have jupyter installed. Then you open it by typing:

jupyter notebook *filename*

in your command line interface to open a specific notebook.
Jupyter can easily be installed using pip or conda.

pip install jupyterlab
pip install notebook
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
conda install -c conda-forge notebook

The code was written using python 3.7.
To run the code you will need to install some libraries. This can be done easily 
if you use either pip or conda for packet and environment management respectively.

If you're new to python packet management: you can usually guess what the command is.
conda install *library_name*
and
pip install *library_name*
works most of the time. Conda even installs dependencies automatically.



*****************************************************************************
* The code assumes you have a file called dump.txt in the same directory as *
* the notebook. You can change this to any filepath using linux notation.   *
* The important thing is that you sanitized the file to only contain 0s,    *
* 1s, and whitespaces. If you didn't do this beforehand then you can do it  *
* in python using either re (regex library) or list operations (strings are *
* lists of chars)                                                           *
